"""
The vibration signals are divided using a sliding window, where each
sample contained 1024 data points. The consecutive windows have a
30% overlap. Each data point has two channels, representing the viÂ­
bration signals from the X and Y directions.

4.1.2. Result analysis of case 1
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we select four
end-to-end fault diagnosis models based on Transformer-CNN:
CLFormer (Fang et al., 2021), Convformer-NSE (Han et al., 2023),
MaxVit (Tu et al., 2022), and MobileVit (Mehta and Rastegari, 2021).
Additionally, we include a widely used CNN fault diagnosis model,
ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), as a baseline for comparison. To reduce the
impact of random errors, each experiment is repeated five times, and
training is conducted for 100 iterations in each experiment.
