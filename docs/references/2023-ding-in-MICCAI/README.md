## Notes

"Datasets:
We have collected 50 high-resolution videos of thoracoscopy-assisted MVR from surgeons and patients, with a resolution of 1920Ã—1080
 and 25 frames per second. Each collected video lasts 30 min - 1 h. 50 videos are randomly divided into training and testing subsets containing 38, and 12 videos, respectively. To evaluate skill level, each video will be rated along various dimensions of technical skill on a scale of 1 to 9 (with higher scores indicating more advanced skill) by at least ten authoritative surgeons who are unaware of the identity of the operating surgeon."
